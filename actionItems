list of cities
--> (lat , long, alt) -> (deg, deg, m)
--> (long,  lat, alt) -> (rad, rad, m)
--> (   x,    y,   z) -> (  m,   m, m)

gs:
    u/d times - gfposc(10 deg w/o buffer)  # TODO: What's the real angle

for city in cities:
    image acq - gfposc(65 deg w/o buffer)  # TODO: What's the real angle
    --> list of times for image all image acquisitions for each city -> [(start t, stop t) ...]

combine all image acquisition times into single list
[(city #, (start t, stop t)) ...]

times for data uplink/downlink
times for image acquisition

take orbit + list of times -> plot the orbit with color different for time
cones + spheres for cities
